# ðŸŒ€ Maze Game with Matter.js

Welcome to the Maze Game! This simple game uses the Matter.js physics engine to create an interactive maze navigation experience. Your goal is to guide a ball through a square maze to reach the designated endpoint.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. **Controls:** Use the W, A, S, D keys to control the movement of the ball.
2. **Objective:** Navigate the ball through the maze to reach the endpoint.
3. **Winning:** Successfully getting the ball to the endpoint completes the level.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevHeris/Maze-Game.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/): A 2D physics engine for the web, used for handling physics interactions in the game.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `demo.js`: This file contains a basic Matter.js setup with dynamic and static bodies, providing an introduction to physics interactions.

## ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgments

- The demo is part of the learning process for developing the Maze Game using Matter.js.
- Built on the Matter.js framework.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the game as you like. Have fun navigating through the maze! ðŸŒŸ
